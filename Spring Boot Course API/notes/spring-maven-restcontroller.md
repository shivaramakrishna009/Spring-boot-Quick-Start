# What is Spring?

**Spring** is a powerful, open-source Java framework designed to simplify building enterprise-grade applications.  
It provides tools, libraries, and abstractions to help you write clean, testable, and maintainable code — without
reinventing the wheel.

# What is Maven?

**Maven** is a build automation and dependency management tool for Java projects.  
It helps developers:

- Manage dependencies (libraries)
- Compile, test, package, and run their applications
- Maintain consistent project structure

Think of Maven as the project manager for Java apps — it tells your app how to build, what libraries to include, and how
to package/run it.

# `@RestController` Annotation:
## What is `@RestController`?

`@RestController` is a specialized version of the `@Controller` annotation in **Spring MVC** and **Spring Boot**.  
It is used to create RESTful web services and APIs.
When you annotate a class with `@RestController`, it indicates that the class will handle HTTP requests and return data directly as
the response body, typically in formats like JSON or XML.

# `@RequestMapping` Annotation:

## What is `@RequestMapping`?

`@RequestMapping` is a core annotation in **Spring MVC** and **Spring Boot** that maps incoming HTTP requests to specific controller classes and handler methods.

It is used to route web requests, making sure the right method handles the requested **URL**, **HTTP method**, **headers**, or **parameters**.
